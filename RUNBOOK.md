## ⚡ Quick Navigation

**Starting a work session?** Go to "Development Workflow" below.
**Something broken?** Jump to "Troubleshooting" (Ctrl+F).
**Need to verify a feature works?** See "Claude in Chrome: Verification Protocol."
**Checking deployment status?** See "URLs & Deployment."

---

## 🔧 Development Workflow

### 1. Before You Start

```bash
# Verify you're on latest main
git checkout main && git pull

# Check what's being worked on (status, completion %)
cat features/INDEX.md

# Check active blockers
cat CLAUDE.md  # See "🚀 Active Work" section
```

### 2. Making Changes

```bash
# Edit code in your editor
vim lib/chat/service.ts

# Build locally to catch errors BEFORE committing
npm run build

# If build fails: read the error, fix it, try again
# Common: missing imports, type mismatches, undefined variables

# Commit with clear message
git add . && git commit -m "feat: description of what changed"

# Push to main (Vercel will auto-deploy)
git push
```

### 3. Verify on Production

```bash
# Wait ~2 minutes for Vercel deployment
# Navigate to: https://audienceos-agro-bros.vercel.app

# Test the feature:
# - Click through the UI
# - Check Console for errors
# - Check Network tab for failed requests
# - Take screenshots if claiming "works"
```

### 4. Update Tracking

```bash
# At end of session, log work to project sheet:
mcp__chi-gateway__sheets_append({
  spreadsheetId: "15wGY-DlE1BV5VBLpU_Jghi3nGiPviaNZXXl9Wth68GI",
  range: "Sheet2!A:E",
  values: [["2026-01-14", "Fixed pipeline loading bug", "3", "Bug Fix", "✅"]]
})
```

## 📱 Claude in Chrome: Verification Protocol

**Use this EVERY TIME you claim a feature works.** Don't guess—verify runtime behavior.

### Setup
1. Open Claude in Chrome (MCP tool)
2. Navigate to [audienceos-agro-bros.vercel.app](https://audienceos-agro-bros.vercel.app)
3. Sign in as test user (available in Supabase)

### Verification Steps
1. **Navigate to feature** - Click through UI to the feature you changed
2. **Trigger the action** - Click button, fill form, whatever should happen
3. **Check Console** - Open DevTools → Console tab
   - Look for red errors (means something broke)
   - Look for custom logs (if you added them)
4. **Check Network** - Open DevTools → Network tab
   - Trigger action again
   - Look for failed requests (red X = 400/500 error)
   - Click successful request → preview tab to see response
5. **Take screenshot** - If claiming "works", show proof (not just "I added the code")

### Examples

**Claim:** "Fixed the client loading issue"
**Evidence:**
- Screenshot showing Network tab with successful `/api/v1/clients` response
- Console showing no errors
- UI showing client list loaded

**Claim:** "Chat is working"
**Evidence:**
- Screenshot showing chat interface
- Network tab showing POST to `/api/chat/route.ts` with response
- Console showing Gemini response parsed correctly

---

## ✅ Verification Commands (Runtime-First Checks)

**CRITICAL RULE:** Never rely on file existence checks alone. Always execute runtime verification.

### Build & Test Verification
```bash
# Verify build passes (REQUIRED before claiming fix)
npm run build

# Run specific test suite
npm run test -- --run __tests__/api/

# Check for TypeScript errors
npx tsc --noEmit
```

### API Endpoint Verification
```bash
# Health check for production
curl -s https://audienceos-agro-bros.vercel.app/api/v1/health | jq .status

# Test client API (requires auth cookie)
# Use Claude in Chrome to verify authenticated endpoints
```

### UI Component Verification (Claude in Chrome Required)
```
# For Add Client Modal:
1. Navigate to Pipeline view
2. Click "Add Client" button
3. Verify modal opens with form fields
4. Check Console for errors
5. Take screenshot as evidence

# For Command Palette:
1. Press Cmd+K (Mac) or Ctrl+K (Windows)
2. Verify navigation items appear (Go to Dashboard, Go to Pipeline, etc.)
3. Test "New Client" quick action opens modal
4. Verify actual navigation works (not just UI display)
```

### Data Contract Verification
```bash
# Check API response shape matches frontend expectations
# Example: Verify stage enum values match
grep -r "VALID_STAGES" app/api/v1/clients/

# Frontend stage values must match backend EXACTLY
# Known issue (fixed): "Off-Boarding" vs "Off-boarding" case mismatch
```

### Session Verification Commands Added: 2026-01-14
- **Issue Found:** Frontend used `Off-boarding`, API validated against `Off-Boarding`
- **Impact:** Clients silently got wrong stage on creation
- **Verification:** Always grep both frontend and backend for enum values

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Build Fails After Changes
```bash
npm run build
# Read the error message carefully
# Common issues:
# - Import missing: Add "import X from 'y'"
# - Type error: Check property names match interface
# - Undefined variable: Make sure it's declared

# Fix it, commit, push
git add . && git commit -m "fix: issue"
git push
```

### "401 No session" on API Calls
**Issue:** Feature data won't load, Network tab shows 401 responses
**Fix:** Fetch calls need `{ credentials: 'include' }`
```typescript
// ❌ WRONG - no cookies sent
const response = await fetch('/api/v1/clients');

// ✅ CORRECT - browser sends auth cookie
const response = await fetch('/api/v1/clients', {
  credentials: 'include'
});
```
**Already fixed in:** All stores, hooks (Commit 59cd1e6). If adding new API call, add this option.

### Sidebar Shows "Loading... Member" Forever
**Issue:** User profile in sidebar footer won't load
**Root Cause:** Stale Supabase auth cookie from old project
**Fix Options:**

Option 1 (Quick): Clear cookies in DevTools
- Open DevTools → Application → Cookies
- Delete all `sb-*-auth-token` cookies
- Refresh page

Option 2 (JavaScript): Run in console
```javascript
// Delete the stale cookie
document.cookie = 'sb-OLD_PROJECT_REF-auth-token=; path=/; expires=Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:01 GMT;';
location.reload();
```

Option 3 (Permanent): Fix was applied in Commit 69c4881
- `hooks/use-auth.ts` now extracts project ref from env var
- Specifically looks for `sb-{projectRef}-auth-token`
- Ignores stale cookies from other projects

### TypeScript Errors in Editor
**Issue:** VS Code shows red squiggles, but code might still compile
```bash
# Get the actual errors:
npx tsc --noEmit

# Or run full build:
npm run build
```

### Feature Not Loading on Production
**Scenario:** Code looks correct, builds pass, but feature doesn't work on prod
**Debug Steps:**

1. **Take screenshot** of broken state
2. **Open DevTools Console** → Look for errors
3. **Open DevTools Network** → Did requests succeed?
4. **Check response data** → Click request → Preview tab
5. **Search for similar issues** in CLAUDE.md troubleshooting section

**Don't assume.** Check actual network responses and console output.

### Phantom Numbers in Sidebar (UI-001)
**Issue:** Random numbers (61, 12, 8) appear next to menu items
**Root Cause:** NOT a code bug—usually browser extension or cached build
**Fix:**
```bash
# 1. Clear Next.js cache
rm -rf .next && npm run dev

# 2. Hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R on Mac, Ctrl+Shift+R on Windows)

# 3. Disable extensions temporarily
# Check if numbers disappear—if yes, one of your extensions is the cause

# 4. Check React DevTools accessibility tree is off
```

---

## 🔌 Environment Setup

### Local Development (`.env.local`)
```bash
# Copy example
cp .env.example .env.local

# Fill in actual values:
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://ebxshdqfaqupnvpghodi.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJ...
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJ...
GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY=AIza...
```

**Don't commit `.env.local`** - It's gitignored for security.

### Vercel Secrets
All env vars are also set in Vercel project settings (handled by Roderic/admins).
No additional action needed—just commit code, push, Vercel uses its env vars.

## 🔗 External Dependencies

### diiiploy-gateway (Product Infrastructure)
**URL:** https://diiiploy-gateway.roderic-andrews.workers.dev

**Purpose:** Centralized API gateway for third-party integrations (Google Ads, DataForSEO, etc.)

**Available Endpoints:**
- `/google-ads/*` - Google Ads API (campaigns, performance, customers)
- `/dataforseo/*` - SEO enrichment (keyword ideas, SERP, domain analysis)

**Note:** AudienceOS uses diiiploy-gateway (not chi-gateway). Chi-gateway is personal PAI infrastructure.

### Google Ads Integration Status
| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| OAuth Flow | ✅ Complete | Refresh token obtained |
| Gateway Secrets | ✅ Complete | All credentials configured |
| Developer Token | ⚠️ Pending | Requires Google approval (5 days) |
| Sync Implementation | ✅ Complete | Code ready at `lib/sync/google-ads-sync.ts` |
| Live Testing | ⏳ Blocked | Waiting on Developer Token approval |

**To Unblock:** Apply for Google Ads API Standard Access at https://ads.google.com/home/tools/manager-accounts/

### DataForSEO Integration
**Status:** ✅ Working (Fixed EP-072: Jan 10)
**Issue:** `dataforseo_ideas` endpoint expects `keywords` array, not `keyword` string
**Fix Location:** `lib/sync/google-ads-sync.ts` → getKeywordIdeas function
**Verification:**
```bash
curl -s https://diiiploy-gateway.roderic-andrews.workers.dev/health | jq .tools
# Should include 7 DataForSEO tools with fix
```

## 📧 Email Infrastructure

**Status:** ⏳ Waiting on DNS configuration

### Current State
- Supabase custom SMTP: DISABLED (using built-in with rate limits)
- Resend account: EXISTS (org: rodericandrews)
- Email issue: Signup confirmation emails don't send

### Solution (Requires DNS Access)
Use subdomain: `audienceos.diiiploy.io`

**Steps:**
1. Add domain to Resend: [resend.com/domains](https://resend.com/domains)
2. Add DNS records Resend provides (MX, SPF, DKIM)
3. Enable custom SMTP in Supabase Auth settings
4. Use `noreply@audienceos.diiiploy.io` as sender

**Owner:** Roderic (DNS access needed)

## 🔐 Critical Rules

**These are non-negotiable. Violating them breaks production.**

1. **Gemini 3 ONLY** - No Gemini 2.x or 1.x anywhere. Check `lib/chat/service.ts`
2. **RLS on all data** - Every table has `agency_id`, every query filters by it
3. **Credentials in fetch** - All API calls must include `{ credentials: 'include' }`
4. **pb-28 on pages** - Every page needs bottom padding for chat overlay
5. **E2E verification** - Test on production with Claude in Chrome, don't guess

See CLAUDE.md for detailed explanation of each rule.
