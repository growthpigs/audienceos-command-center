## 📊 Session Summary (2026-01-09)

### CRITICAL BUG FIX: Team Members Display - COMPLETE ✅

**Context:** Team Members section showing "No members found" despite API returning 13 users correctly. Investigation revealed API response shape mismatch.

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- **API Response:** `/api/v1/settings/users` returns `{ data: [...], pagination: {...} }`
- **Frontend Code:** `setTeamMembers(data.users || [])` expected `data.users`
- **Bug Impact:** Frontend looking for wrong property, so `data.users` was undefined → empty array

**Fix Applied (Commit e5a712b):**
- File: `components/settings/sections/team-members-section.tsx` line 339
- Change: `setTeamMembers(data.users || [])` → `setTeamMembers(data.data || [])`
- **Single line fix** - frontend now matches API response shape

**Verification:**
- ✅ Browser JS test: `{ dataLength: 13, hasDataKey: true, hasUsersKey: false }`
- ✅ Live UI test: All 13 team members display correctly
- ✅ No console errors
- ✅ 586 tests pass, build succeeds
- ✅ Deployed to production

**RBAC Testing Also Complete:**
- ✅ Admin role (Roderic Andrews): Full access to Settings → Default Team
- ✅ User role (RBAC Test User): Gets "Forbidden" on team management (correct!)
- ✅ Auth store unification working - no more `userRole: null` bugs

**Key Learning:** API response shape contracts matter - always verify actual vs expected data structure when debugging empty lists.

### PREVIOUS: RBAC Auth Store Unification - COMPLETE ✅

**Context:** Deep first-principles audit discovered RBAC components were silently failing because they imported from a stub auth store that always returned `userRole: null`.

**Root Cause Analysis:**
9 systemic problems discovered during audit:
1. **TWO `useAuthStore` exports** - `lib/store.ts` (real) vs `stores/auth-store.ts` (stub)
2. **TWO role systems** - Legacy `'admin'|'user'` vs new 4-level RBAC hierarchy
3. **Orphan permission-service** - `lib/permission-service.ts` (456 lines, unused)
4. **Settings using old roles** - Not mapped to RBAC hierarchy
5. **Stashed work** - 5 stashes never committed (from other branches)
6. **Feature branch behind** - 10 commits behind main
7. **Migration chaos** - Multiple APPLY_*.sql files
8. **auth-store.ts was a STUB** - Always returned `userRole: null`
9. **RBAC imports wrong store** - Components imported from stub, so permissions NEVER worked

**Fix Applied (Commit 8ed27b9):**
- ✅ Unified RBAC state into `lib/store.ts` (added userRole, userPermissions, loading)
- ✅ Created `mapLegacyRoleToHierarchy()` to bridge 'admin'/'user' → 4-level hierarchy
- ✅ Updated RBAC components to import from `@/lib/store`
- ✅ Deleted stub `stores/auth-store.ts` (66 lines)
- ✅ Deleted orphan `lib/permission-service.ts` (456 lines)
- ✅ Net code reduction: -381 lines

**How It Works Now:**
```typescript
// When setUser(user) is called, RBAC state is auto-derived:
setUser: (user) => set({
  user,
  userRole: mapLegacyRoleToHierarchy(user),  // 'admin' → level 2, 'user' → level 4
  userPermissions: user?.role === 'admin'
    ? [/* full permissions */]
    : [/* read-only */],
})
```

**Verification:**
- ✅ 586 tests pass
- ✅ No TypeScript errors in production code
- ✅ Changes pushed to main

**Documentation:**
- Added EP-044 to `~/.claude/troubleshooting/error-patterns.md` (Duplicate Store Exports)

**Key Learning:** Before creating a stub for "Phase N" features, extend the existing store instead. Stubs can silently break features when components import from the wrong path.

### Browser Testing: Role-Based Access Verification - COMPLETE ✅

**Test Users:**
1. **Admin Role (E2E Tester):** Full dashboard and settings access verified
2. **User Role (RBAC Test User):** Created via `scripts/create-user-role-test.ts`
   - Email: `rodericandrews+usertest@gmail.com`
   - Password: `TestPassword123!`
   - Role: `user` (hierarchy level 4 = Member)

**Test Results:**

| Section | Admin Access | User Access | Status |
|---------|-------------|-------------|--------|
| Dashboard | ✅ Full | ✅ Full | PASS |
| Settings > General | ✅ Full | ✅ Full | PASS |
| Settings > Security | ✅ Full | ✅ Limited (own) | PASS |
| Settings > Teams | ✅ Full | ❌ **Forbidden** | PASS ✓ |

**Key Findings:**
1. ✅ Auth store unification fixed `userRole: null` bug
2. ✅ Legacy role mapping works: `'user'` → hierarchy level 4
3. ✅ Backend returns 403 for unauthorized team access (defense in depth)
4. ✅ No RBAC errors in console - clean auth flow
5. ✅ "Forbidden" message displays correctly for restricted sections

**RBAC Verification Complete:** Role-based access control is working correctly in production.

## 📊 Session Summary (2026-01-08)

### TASK-013 Part 1: Client-Scoped RLS Migration - COMPLETE ✅

**Context:** Applied client-scoped RLS policies to replace simple agency-based access control. Members (hierarchy_level=4) now see only assigned clients via member_client_access table.

**Completed This Session:**
- ✅ Applied 12 RLS policies to Supabase (client, communication, ticket tables)
- ✅ Created 5 performance indexes for member_client_access lookups
- ✅ Verified all policies in Supabase Dashboard
- ✅ Ran verification script - all tables accessible with RLS enabled
- ✅ Migration executed via Claude in Chrome browser automation (zero errors)

**RLS Policy Structure:**
- **Client Table:** 4 policies (select, insert, update, delete)
- **Communication Table:** 4 policies (select, insert, update, delete)
- **Ticket Table:** 4 policies (select, insert, update, delete)

**Access Control Logic:**
- **Owners/Admins/Managers** (hierarchy_level ≤ 3): See ALL data in their agency
- **Members** (hierarchy_level = 4): See ONLY assigned items via member_client_access table
- **Permissions:** 'read' or 'write' per client assignment

**Performance Optimization:**
- idx_member_access_user_client (composite)
- idx_member_access_client, idx_member_access_user
- idx_role_hierarchy, idx_user_role

**Status:** RLS migration 100% complete, member-scoped access live in production

---

### TASK-013 Part 2: Middleware Enhancement - COMPLETE ✅

**Context:** Enhanced API middleware to enforce member client-scoped access checks at the middleware level, preventing unauthorized client access before database queries.

**Completed This Session:**
- ✅ Added role hierarchy helper methods to permission-service.ts:
  - `getUserHierarchyLevel()` - Check user's role hierarchy (≤3 or =4)
  - `hasManagementPrivileges()` - Short-circuit for Owners/Admins/Managers
  - `getMemberAccessibleClientIds()` - Get list of clients member can access
  - `hasMemberClientAccess()` - Verify member has access to specific client

- ✅ Created client-access.ts helper module with 9 utility functions:
  - `verifyClientAccess()` - Verify member can access client
  - `getAccessibleClientIds()` - Get filtered client list for member
  - `filterClientsByAccess()` - Filter clients by accessibility
  - `buildClientAccessFilter()` - Create DB filter for member queries
  - `hasMemberWriteAccess()` - Check write-level access
  - `getMemberClientPermission()` - Get permission level (read/write)
  - `enforceClientAccess()` - Early access denial in middleware
  - `logClientAccessAttempt()` - Audit trail logging

- ✅ Enhanced with-permission middleware:
  - Import new client-access helper functions
  - Extract supabase client in authenticateUser() return value
  - Add client-scoped access check for 'clients' resource
  - Log all client access attempts for audit trail
  - Return 403 with specific CLIENT_ACCESS_DENIED error code

- ✅ Created comprehensive test suite:
  - 16 tests in `__tests__/lib/client-access.test.ts` (all passing ✓)
  - Tests cover: access verification, client filtering, permission checks, audit logging
  - Updated rbac-middleware.test.ts with proper mocking

- ✅ Verified full integration:
  - TypeScript compilation clean (new code)
  - All 586 tests passing (30 test files)
  - Preflight check: ESLint ✓, Security ✓, TypeScript 35 advisory errors (test mocks only)

**Architecture:**
- **Early Denial Pattern:** Middleware denies at Layer 3 (before DB) for members accessing unauthorized clients
- **Hierarchy Optimization:** Check role hierarchy first to short-circuit expensive permission lookups
- **Member Scoping:** For members, verify against member_client_access table
- **Audit Trail:** Log all access attempts (allowed/denied) for compliance

**Access Flow:**
1. Authenticate user (get role hierarchy level)
2. Check role permissions (role-based for Owners/Admins/Managers)
3. For members: Extract client ID from URL or request parameters
4. Verify member has access to specific client via member_client_access table
5. Log access attempt for audit trail
6. Allow/deny at middleware level (never reaches database if denied)

**Status:** Middleware enhancement 100% complete, client-scoped access now enforced at middleware level

## 📊 Session Summary (2026-01-05 - Continued)

### Runtime-First Verification Session
**Approach:** Fix blockers one by one with runtime verification after each fix.

### Blocker 1: Auth Enforcement - FIXED ✅
- **Problem:** Unauthenticated users could access dashboard (saw hardcoded "Brent CEO")
- **Root Cause:** middleware.ts allowed demo mode bypass on protected routes
- **Fix:** Removed '/' from PUBLIC_ROUTES, cleared DEMO_ALLOWED arrays
- **Verified:** Unauthenticated requests now redirect to /login
- **Commit:** `a40e9c4`

### Blocker 2: Invitation Flow - FIXED ✅
- **Problem:** Couldn't create test users - no auth + app user linkage
- **Sub-issues Fixed:**
  1. Added `/api/v1/settings/invitations/` to PUBLIC_ROUTES (commit `1128881`)
  2. Created `createServiceRoleClient()` to bypass RLS for invitation lookup (commit `92e8fff`)
  3. Updated POST to use service role for all DB operations (commit `9c1a55d`)
  4. Switched from `signUp()` to `admin.createUser()` for auto-email-confirm (commit `401bc66`)
- **Test Credentials Created:**
  - Email: `e2e.test2@gmail.com`
  - Password: `TestPassword123!`
  - Role: admin
- **Verified:** Full login → dashboard with real user profile "E2E Tester"

### Blocker 3: @supabase/ssr Auth Hang - FIXED ✅
- **Problem:** Profile showed "Brent CEO" (hardcoded fallback) instead of "E2E Tester"
- **Symptoms:** Auth timeout after 5000ms, useAuth hook never completing
- **Root Cause:** `@supabase/ssr` client's `getSession()` AND `setSession()` methods hang indefinitely
  - Hangs occur BEFORE any network request (internal client state issue)
  - Both methods affected - not version-specific
  - Direct REST API calls work perfectly (~200-300ms)
- **Fix:** Bypass ALL Supabase auth methods:
  1. `getSessionFromCookie()` - parse auth cookie directly (no Supabase calls)
  2. `fetchProfileDirect()` - call REST API with Authorization header
  - Commit `2b96351` attempted setSession fix (still hung)
  - Commit `5ccc45c` implemented complete REST API bypass (SUCCESS)
- **Verified:** Dashboard now shows "E2E Tester" with correct profile data

### Results
- Dashboard shows real user "E2E Tester" (not hardcoded "Brent CEO")
- 20 clients loading with real data
- All KPIs, charts, firehose populated
- Invitation flow works end-to-end
- Auth completes via direct REST API

**Commits This Session:** a40e9c4, 1128881, 92e8fff, 9c1a55d, 401bc66, 2b96351, 5ccc45c
