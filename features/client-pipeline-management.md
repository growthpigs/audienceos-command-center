New fields needed:
| Entity | Field | Type | Description |
|--------|-------|------|-------------|
| CLIENT | days_in_stage | Integer | Auto-calculated from stage_events |
| CLIENT | health_status | Enum | green/yellow/red visual indicator |
| STAGE_EVENT | notes | Text | Optional reason for stage movement |

---

## UI Components

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| PipelineKanban | Main board container with 6 columns |

## Edge Cases

| Scenario | Expected Behavior |
|----------|-------------------|
| User drags to same column | No API call, visual feedback only |
| Drag to Off-Boarding stage | Show confirmation modal before move |
| Network error during move | Rollback UI, show error toast, enable retry |
| Multiple users move same client | Real-time update wins, show notification |
| Client has no assignments | Show "Unassigned" in owner field |
| More than 10 clients in column | Show pagination controls at bottom |
| Stage history is empty | Show "No stage changes yet" message |
| Client drawer opens on mobile | Full-screen modal instead of drawer |

---

## Technical Implementation

### Drag & Drop with dnd-kit
```typescript
const sensors = useSensors(
  useSensor(PointerSensor, { activationConstraint: { distance: 8 } }),
  useSensor(KeyboardSensor, { coordinateGetter: sortableKeyboardCoordinates })
);

function handleDragEnd(event: DragEndEvent) {
  const { active, over } = event;
  if (!over) return;

  const clientId = active.id;
  const newStage = over.id as string;

  // Optimistic update
  updateClientStageOptimistic(clientId, newStage);

  // API call
  moveClient(clientId, newStage).catch(() => {
    // Rollback on error
    revertClientStage(clientId);
    showErrorToast();
  });
}
```

### Real-time Updates
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  const subscription = supabase
    .channel('pipeline-updates')
    .on('postgres_changes',
      { event: 'UPDATE', schema: 'public', table: 'client' },
      handleClientUpdate
    )
    .subscribe();

  return () => subscription.unsubscribe();
}, []);
```

### URL State Management
```typescript
const [filters, setFilters] = useQueryParams({
  stage: withDefault(ArrayParam, []),
  owner: StringParam,
  health: StringParam,
  client_id: StringParam // For drawer deep linking
});
```

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Happy path: Load board → drag client → confirm move → success
- [ ] Error handling: Network failure → UI rollback → retry works
- [ ] Real-time: Other user moves client → board updates automatically
- [ ] Filtering: All filter combinations work and persist in URL
- [ ] Drawer: Opens/closes correctly, tabs work, deep linking functions
- [ ] Mobile: Responsive layout, touch-friendly drag operations
- [ ] Accessibility: Keyboard navigation, screen reader support
- [ ] Performance: Large datasets (100+ clients) load smoothly
- [ ] Pagination: Column overflow handled correctly

---

## Performance Considerations

### Virtualization
For agencies with 100+ clients, implement virtual scrolling within columns to maintain smooth performance.

### Optimistic Updates
All drag operations update UI immediately with API call in background. Rollback on failure ensures consistency.

### Real-time Efficiency
Supabase Realtime subscription filtered to agency_id to minimize unnecessary updates.

### Data Fetching
Use React Query with stale-while-revalidate pattern for optimal UX.

---

## Dependencies

### Required for Implementation
- dnd-kit (drag & drop)
- Zustand (state management)
- React Query (server state)
- Supabase Realtime (live updates)

### Blocked By
- CLIENT table with RLS policies
- STAGE_EVENT audit trail table
- CLIENT_ASSIGNMENT for ownership filtering
- Supabase Auth for tenant isolation

### Enables
- Dashboard drill-down (click KPI → filtered pipeline)
- Communications timeline (client drawer tab)
- Task management (client drawer tab)
- Alert generation (based on days_in_stage)
