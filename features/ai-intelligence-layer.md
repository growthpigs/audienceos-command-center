## ⚠️ STANDALONE PROJECT NOTICE

**This feature has been extracted to a standalone project for focused development and validation.**

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Standalone Project | `/Users/rodericandrews/_PAI/projects/chi-intelligent-chat/` |
| Architecture | Gemini-First (File Search, Google Search Grounding, Flash) |
| Spec Location | `chi-intelligent-chat/features/chi-intelligent-chat.md` |
| Re-integration | Copy back after validation |

**Why standalone?**
- This is the flagship "Holy Grail Chat" feature
- Needs focused development without affecting other AudienceOS work
- Allows architecture validation before integration
- Uses Gemini-first stack (different from original Claude-based plan)

**When to re-integrate:**
1. Standalone project validated and working
2. Copy components to AudienceOS `components/ai/`
3. Copy spec back here (replacing below content)
4. Update features/INDEX.md

**The spec below is preserved for reference but the ACTIVE spec is in the standalone project.**

## Performance Considerations

### Token Budget Management
```typescript
class TokenBudgetManager {
  private readonly DAILY_LIMIT = 50000;

  async checkBudget(agencyId: string): Promise<{ allowed: boolean; remaining: number }> {
    const usage = await this.getTodayUsage(agencyId);
    return {
      allowed: usage < this.DAILY_LIMIT,
      remaining: Math.max(0, this.DAILY_LIMIT - usage)
    };
  }

  async recordUsage(agencyId: string, tokens: number, feature: string): Promise<void> {
    await supabase
      .from('ai_usage')
      .insert({
        agency_id: agencyId,
        tokens_used: tokens,
        feature,
        timestamp: new Date()
      });
  }
}
```

### Caching Strategy
- RAG responses cached for 1 hour per query
- Self-awareness responses cached indefinitely (until app updates)
- Memory searches cached for 5 minutes per user
- Document indexing cached until document updated
- Alert rules cached for 30 minutes

### Response Optimization
- Use Claude 3.5 Haiku for simple queries (<1s response)
- Use Claude 3.5 Sonnet for complex analysis (2-4s response)
- Stream responses for better perceived performance
- Implement request queuing during high load
- Use parallel processing for multiple AI services

---

## Dependencies

### Required for Implementation
- Claude API (chat, risk detection, draft generation)
- Gemini File Search (RAG and document indexing)
- Mem0 (cross-session memory storage)
- Exa API (web search capabilities)
- Supabase Realtime (alert notifications)

### Blocked By
- ALERT table with proper indexes and RLS policies
- CHAT_SESSION and CHAT_MESSAGE tables
- DOCUMENT table with Gemini integration
- AI usage tracking infrastructure
- Token budget management system

### Enables
- Proactive client management (early risk detection)
- Faster response times (AI drafts and suggestions)
- Knowledge management (document-based answers)
- Reduced support load (self-service AI help)
- Data-driven insights (pattern recognition)

---

## Success Metrics

- **Proactive Detection:** 80% of client risks flagged by AI before manual escalation
- **Response Speed:** 50% reduction in average response time with AI drafts
- **Alert Accuracy:** <15% false positive rate on critical alerts
- **User Adoption:** 70% of Account Managers use AI assistant weekly
- **Knowledge Utilization:** 60% of AI responses include document citations
- **Memory Effectiveness:** 40% of queries benefit from cross-session context
- **Self-Awareness Usage:** 30% of queries are about app features/capabilities
- **Token Efficiency:** <80% of daily budget used during peak usage

### Data Protection
- All AI interactions logged for audit trails
- No sensitive client data in AI training sets
- Document encryption at rest in Supabase Storage
- Memory data scoped strictly by tenant + user

### API Security
```typescript
class AISecurityGuard {
  async validateQuery(query: string, context: ChatContext): Promise<boolean> {
    // Check for potential data exfiltration attempts
    if (this.containsSensitivePatterns(query)) {
      await this.logSecurityEvent(query, context.userId);
      return false;
    }

    // Validate user permissions for requested data
    if (!await this.checkDataAccess(context.userId, context.agencyId)) {
      return false;
    }

    return true;
  }

  private containsSensitivePatterns(query: string): boolean {
    const sensitivePatterns = [
      /password|secret|token|key/i,
      /sql|database|export.*all/i,
      /delete|drop|truncate/i
    ];

    return sensitivePatterns.some(pattern => pattern.test(query));
  }
}
```

### Content Filtering
- Real-time content moderation for AI responses
- Blocklist for inappropriate content generation
- User reporting system for AI misbehavior
- Regular audit of AI conversation logs
