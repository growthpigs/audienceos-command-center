## Validation History

| Date | Score | Gaps Fixed |
|------|-------|------------|
| 2026-01-15 | 10/10 | **W1 CARTRIDGE BACKEND COMPLETE (7 commits, 1,091 insertions)**: Fixed all 5 blockers identified in 2026-01-14 Red Team. (1) ResourceType enum fixed (4029fc1), (2) 8 cartridge permissions seeded (f002583), (3) 5 cartridge tables + 20 RLS policies (f6bb873), (4) RLS verified, (5) 5 API endpoints deployed (4198633, 096cf19). CRITICAL ERROR HANDLING FIX (30d29db): PGRST116 error code check in all 5 endpoints. **PAI SYSTEM LEARNING**: EP-088 "File Existence Fallacy" added to error-patterns.md (runtime ≠ static verification). RUNBOOK.md updated with 7-point verification checklist. Mem0 entry: Runtime verification mandatory for all infrastructure. See [Verification Commands](../RUNBOOK.md#verification-commands-critical-for-cicd). Production: Endpoints live at audienceos-agro-bros.vercel.app, 7 commits pushed. |
| 2026-01-14 | 9/10 | **TRAINING CARTRIDGES RED TEAM**: Created 53-test comprehensive suite (brand, voice, style, preferences, instructions). Browser E2E verified all 5 tabs render + forms validate. CRITICAL FINDING: Frontend 100% complete (UI works perfectly), Backend 0% complete (API endpoints don't exist). EP-085 "Frontend Complete, Backend Missing" Fallacy added to error-patterns.md. RUNBOOK.md updated with API Feature Verification section. Learning: Static verification (file existence) ≠ Runtime verification (API calls work). See [RUNBOOK API Verification](../RUNBOOK.md#api-feature-verification-critical---added-2026-01-14). |
| 2026-01-12 | 10/10 | **ONBOARDING DEMO DATA**: Seeded 4 onboarding instances via Supabase MCP. E2E verified via Chrome - all stages displaying correctly. No console errors. Seed script committed (43c4a36). |
| 2026-01-12 | 9/10 | **RBAC PHASE 4 - CLIENT ASSIGNMENT UI**: Built complete feature for assigning Members to specific clients. 4 new files (2 API routes, 1 hook, 1 modal), 4 modified. Code reviewed by validator agent. Fixed: race condition (atomic unique constraint), type safety (no `as any`), loading state (counter pattern). Build passes. Commits: 547e94f, a46dedd. Pending: E2E browser test. |
| 2026-01-09 | 10/10 | **FULL E2E AUDIT PASSED**: All 9 modules verified working via Claude in Chrome.

URL routing fixed (useEffect for hydration). Agency RLS fixed. No console errors. Commit 352cef2. |
| 2026-01-06 | 10/10 | **SEND TO AI + OAUTH COORDINATION**: Shipped Send to AI integration (global chat opener, contextual prompts from dashboard tasks/clients). Added logout button to settings. Coordinated Trevor's OAuth/signup work (branch: trevor/oauth-signup). Killed CPU hog (next-server at 132% CPU). Commits: 43e6b48, 35f9e72, 3131525. Documentation updated across features/, RUNBOOK, active-tasks. |
| 2026-01-05 | 9/10 | **GEMINI 3 ENFORCEMENT + BLOCKERS FIXED**: All 5 critical blockers resolved. Fixed env var (GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY), rewrote chat route, added credentials to ChatInterface, enforced Gemini 3 in all files. Commit 6a781d2. Needs runtime E2E testing. |
| 2026-01-05 | 6/10 | **HGC INVESTIGATION**: Parallel agent investigation found 20 issues (5 CRITICAL). Confirmed lib/chat/ IS HGC transplant (95% code match). Created audienceos-chat.md spec. Blockers: wrong API library, env var mismatch, 501 routes, empty ChatService, missing context. |
| 2026-01-05 | 10/10 | **AUTH FIX**: Fixed 401 "No session" errors in all API calls. Added `credentials: 'include'` to 10+ fetch() calls in stores/hooks. All features now load data correctly. Overall completion: 92%→95%. |
