# FEATURE SPEC: Multi-Org Roles (RBAC)

**What:** Role-based access control system with granular permissions for multi-tenant agency management
**Who:** Agency Owners and Admins managing team access; Members with restricted access
**Why:** Enable fine-grained control over who can view, modify, or manage specific features and data
**Status:** 📝 Specced

## User Stories

**US-042: View and Manage Roles**
As an Agency Owner, I want to view and manage roles in my organization, so that I can control access levels.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] View all roles: name, description, member count, creation date
- [ ] See built-in roles: Owner, Admin, Manager, Member (cannot delete)
- [ ] View custom roles created by agency
- [ ] Role detail view shows all assigned permissions
- [ ] Filter roles by type (built-in vs custom)
- [ ] Search roles by name

**US-043: Assign Permissions to Roles**
As an Agency Owner, I want to assign specific permissions to roles, so that I can control what each role can do.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Permission matrix UI: Resources × Actions (read/write/manage)
- [ ] Resources: clients, communications, tickets, knowledge-base, automations, settings, users, billing
- [ ] Actions: read (view), write (create/edit), manage (delete/admin)
- [ ] Bulk permission assignment (toggle entire column/row)
- [ ] Preview affected users when modifying role permissions
- [ ] Cannot remove permissions from Owner role

**US-044: Enforce Permissions at API Level**
As a Developer, I want permissions enforced at the API level, so that security is not client-dependent.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Middleware intercepts all API requests
- [ ] Permission check against user's effective permissions
- [ ] 403 Forbidden response with clear error message
- [ ] Audit log of permission denials
- [ ] RLS policies enforce data isolation
- [ ] No client-side-only permission checks

**US-045: Custom Role Creation**
As an Agency Admin, I want to create custom roles, so that I can match my team's structure.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Create role: name (unique), description, base permissions
- [ ] Clone existing role as starting point
- [ ] Assign custom role to users
- [ ] Edit custom role permissions at any time
- [ ] Delete custom role (must reassign users first)
- [ ] Maximum 10 custom roles per agency

## Functional Requirements

What this feature DOES:
- [ ] Provide hierarchical role system with Owner, Admin, Manager, Member built-in roles
- [ ] Enable granular permission assignment per resource and action type
- [ ] Enforce permissions at API middleware level with RLS backup
- [ ] Support custom role creation with inherited permissions
- [ ] Maintain audit trail of all permission changes and denials
- [ ] Protect Owner role from modification or removal
- [ ] Support client-level access restrictions for Members
- [ ] Enable conditional UI rendering based on user permissions
- [ ] Provide permission inheritance and precedence rules
- [ ] Support bulk permission operations for efficiency

What this feature does NOT do:
- ❌ Support cross-agency role sharing or templates

## Role Types

### Built-in Roles (Cannot Delete)

| Role | Description | Typical Use |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **Owner** | Agency creator with full access, cannot be removed | Agency founder, primary account holder |
| **Admin** | Full access except billing modification | Operations lead, senior managers |
| **Manager** | Client management, no settings or user management | Account managers, project leads |
| **Member** | Read-only + assigned clients write access | Junior staff, contractors, specialists |

### Role Hierarchy

```
Owner (highest)
  └── Admin
       └── Manager
            └── Member (lowest)
```

**Hierarchy Rules:**
- Users can only assign roles at or below their own level
- Users cannot modify users with roles above their own
- Owner can modify all roles and users
- Admin cannot modify Owner or other Admins' roles

### Custom Roles

- Created by Owner or Admin
- Based on any permission combination
- Not part of hierarchy (flat structure)
- Maximum 10 per agency
- Must have unique name within agency

---

## Permission Matrix

### Resource × Role → Default Permissions

| Resource | Owner | Admin | Manager | Member |
|----------|-------|-------|---------|--------|
| **clients** | manage | manage | write | read* |
| **communications** | manage | manage | write | read* |
| **tickets** | manage | manage | write | read* |
| **knowledge-base** | manage | manage | write | read |
| **automations** | manage | manage | read | none |
| **settings** | manage | manage | none | none |
| **users** | manage | manage | read | none |
| **billing** | manage | read | none | none |
| **roles** | manage | write | read | none |
| **integrations** | manage | manage | read | none |
| **analytics** | manage | manage | write | read |
| **ai-features** | manage | manage | write | read |

**Legend:**
- `manage` = read + write + delete + admin actions
- `write` = read + create + edit
- `read` = view only
- `none` = no access
- `*` = only for assigned clients (see Client-Level Access)

### Permission Actions Detail

| Action | Description | Example Operations |
|--------|-------------|--------------------|
| `read` | View data | List clients, view communications, read tickets |
| `write` | Modify data | Create clients, send messages, update tickets |
| `delete` | Remove data | Archive clients, delete documents |
| `manage` | Full control | All above + configure settings, manage access |

### Client-Level Access (Members)

Members have restricted access based on client assignments:

```typescript
interface ClientAccess {
  client_id: string;
  permission: 'read' | 'write';
  assigned_by: string;
  assigned_at: Date;
}
```

- Members see ONLY clients they're assigned to
- Assignment grants read or write on that client's data
- Unassigned clients are invisible (not just read-only)
- Admins/Managers can assign clients to Members

**Migration Strategy:**
```sql
-- Step 1: Create new tables
CREATE TABLE role (...);
CREATE TABLE permission (...);
CREATE TABLE role_permission (...);
CREATE TABLE member_client_access (...);

-- Step 2: Seed system roles for each agency
INSERT INTO role (agency_id, name, is_system, hierarchy_level)
SELECT id, 'Owner', true, 1 FROM agency
UNION ALL
SELECT id, 'Admin', true, 2 FROM agency
UNION ALL
SELECT id, 'Manager', true, 3 FROM agency
UNION ALL
SELECT id, 'Member', true, 4 FROM agency;

-- Step 3: Seed permissions
INSERT INTO permission (resource, action) VALUES
('clients', 'read'), ('clients', 'write'), ('clients', 'delete'), ('clients', 'manage'),
('communications', 'read'), ('communications', 'write'), ('communications', 'delete'), ('communications', 'manage'),
-- ... etc for all resources

-- Step 4: Seed default role_permissions
-- (complex INSERT based on permission matrix above)

-- Step 5: Add role_id to users
ALTER TABLE "user" ADD COLUMN role_id UUID REFERENCES role(id);

-- Step 6: Migrate existing roles
UPDATE "user" u
SET role_id = r.id
FROM role r
WHERE r.agency_id = u.agency_id
AND r.name = CASE
  WHEN u.role = 'admin' THEN 'Admin'
  ELSE 'Member'
END;

-- Step 7: Set first admin per agency as Owner
UPDATE "user" u
SET role_id = r.id, is_owner = true
FROM role r
WHERE r.agency_id = u.agency_id
AND r.name = 'Owner'
AND u.id = (
  SELECT MIN(id) FROM "user" u2
  WHERE u2.agency_id = u.agency_id AND u2.role = 'admin'
);

-- Step 8: Drop old column (after validation)
ALTER TABLE "user" DROP COLUMN role;
```

## Enforcement Points

### 1. API Middleware Pattern

```typescript
// lib/middleware/permission-guard.ts
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server';
import { getAuthenticatedUser } from '@/lib/auth';
import { getUserPermissions, checkPermission } from '@/lib/rbac';

interface PermissionRequirement {
  resource: string;
  action: 'read' | 'write' | 'delete' | 'manage';
  clientScoped?: boolean; // For Member client-level access
}

export function withPermission(requirement: PermissionRequirement) {
  return async function middleware(
    req: NextRequest,
    handler: (req: NextRequest) => Promise<NextResponse>
  ): Promise<NextResponse> {
    const user = await getAuthenticatedUser(req);

    if (!user) {
      return NextResponse.json(
        { error: 'Unauthorized', code: 'AUTH_REQUIRED' },
        { status: 401 }
      );
    }

    const permissions = await getUserPermissions(user.id, user.agency_id);

    // Check base permission
    if (!checkPermission(permissions, requirement.resource, requirement.action)) {
      await logPermissionDenial(user, requirement, req);
      return NextResponse.json(
        {
          error: 'Forbidden',
          code: 'PERMISSION_DENIED',
          required: `${requirement.resource}:${requirement.action}`,
          message: `You do not have permission to ${requirement.action} ${requirement.resource}`
        },
        { status: 403 }
      );
    }

    // For Members, check client-level access if required
    if (requirement.clientScoped && user.role.hierarchy_level === 4) {
      const clientId = extractClientId(req);
      if (clientId && !await hasClientAccess(user.id, clientId, requirement.action)) {
        await logPermissionDenial(user, requirement, req);
        return NextResponse.json(
          {
            error: 'Forbidden',
            code: 'CLIENT_ACCESS_DENIED',
            message: 'You do not have access to this client'
          },
          { status: 403 }
        );
      }
    }

    return handler(req);
  };
}

// Usage in API route
export const GET = withPermission({ resource: 'clients', action: 'read' })(
  async (req: NextRequest) => {
    // Handler code here - permission already verified
  }
);
```

### 2. RLS Policies

```sql
-- Enhanced client RLS with role-based access
CREATE POLICY client_role_rls ON client FOR SELECT
USING (
  agency_id = (auth.jwt() ->> 'agency_id')::uuid
  AND (
    -- Owners, Admins, Managers see all clients
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM "user" u
      JOIN role r ON u.role_id = r.id
      WHERE u.id = auth.uid()
      AND r.hierarchy_level <= 3
    )
    OR
    -- Members see only assigned clients
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM member_client_access mca
      WHERE mca.user_id = auth.uid()
      AND mca.client_id = client.id
    )
  )
);

-- Write access requires write permission or assignment
CREATE POLICY client_write_rls ON client FOR UPDATE
USING (
  agency_id = (auth.jwt() ->> 'agency_id')::uuid
  AND (
    -- Users with clients:write permission
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM "user" u
      JOIN role r ON u.role_id = r.id
      JOIN role_permission rp ON rp.role_id = r.id
      JOIN permission p ON p.id = rp.permission_id
      WHERE u.id = auth.uid()
      AND p.resource = 'clients'
      AND p.action IN ('write', 'manage')
    )
    OR
    -- Members with write access to this client
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM member_client_access mca
      WHERE mca.user_id = auth.uid()
      AND mca.client_id = client.id
      AND mca.permission = 'write'
    )
  )
);
```

### 3. Frontend Conditional Rendering

```typescript
// hooks/use-permission.ts
import { useAuth } from '@/hooks/use-auth';
import { useMemo } from 'react';

interface UsePermissionResult {
  can: (resource: string, action: string) => boolean;
  canAny: (checks: Array<{ resource: string; action: string }>) => boolean;
  canAll: (checks: Array<{ resource: string; action: string }>) => boolean;
  isOwner: boolean;
  isAdmin: boolean;
  role: Role | null;
  permissions: Permission[];
  loading: boolean;
}

export function usePermission(): UsePermissionResult {
  const { user, permissions, loading } = useAuth();

  const permissionSet = useMemo(() => {
    return new Set(permissions.map(p => `${p.resource}:${p.action}`));
  }, [permissions]);

  const can = (resource: string, action: string): boolean => {
    if (loading) return false;

    // Manage includes all lower permissions
    if (permissionSet.has(`${resource}:manage`)) return true;
    if (action === 'write' && permissionSet.has(`${resource}:write`)) return true;
    if (action === 'read' && (permissionSet.has(`${resource}:read`) || permissionSet.has(`${resource}:write`))) return true;

    return permissionSet.has(`${resource}:${action}`);
  };

  const canAny = (checks: Array<{ resource: string; action: string }>): boolean => {
    return checks.some(({ resource, action }) => can(resource, action));
  };

  const canAll = (checks: Array<{ resource: string; action: string }>): boolean => {
    return checks.every(({ resource, action }) => can(resource, action));
  };

  return {
    can,
    canAny,
    canAll,
    isOwner: user?.is_owner ?? false,
    isAdmin: user?.role?.hierarchy_level <= 2,
    role: user?.role ?? null,
    permissions,
    loading
  };
}

// components/permission-gate.tsx
interface PermissionGateProps {
  resource: string;
  action: string;
  children: React.ReactNode;
  fallback?: React.ReactNode;
}

export function PermissionGate({ resource, action, children, fallback = null }: PermissionGateProps) {
  const { can, loading } = usePermission();

  if (loading) return null;
  if (!can(resource, action)) return fallback;

  return <>{children}</>;
}

// Usage
<PermissionGate resource="settings" action="write">
  <Button onClick={saveSettings}>Save Settings</Button>
</PermissionGate>

<PermissionGate
  resource="users"
  action="manage"
  fallback={<span className="text-muted-foreground">Contact admin to manage users</span>}
>
  <UserManagementPanel />
</PermissionGate>
```

## Edge Cases

| Scenario | Expected Behavior |
|----------|-------------------|
| Last Owner tries to downgrade themselves | Block with error "Agency must have at least one Owner" |
| Last Owner tries to leave agency | Block with error "Transfer ownership before leaving" |
| Delete role with assigned users | Show modal requiring user reassignment before deletion |
| Downgrade user with active client assignments | Preserve assignments if new role supports client access, else warn |
| Custom role permission exceeds hierarchy | Allow (custom roles are flat, no hierarchy enforcement) |
| Admin tries to modify Owner | Block with 403 "Cannot modify Owner role" |
| Member tries to access unassigned client | Return 403 with "You do not have access to this client" |
| Concurrent permission modifications | Use optimistic locking, show conflict resolution |
| Agency reaches 10 custom role limit | Block creation with "Maximum custom roles reached" message |
| User's role deleted while logged in | On next request, redirect to role-changed notice |
| Permission cache stale | Cache TTL of 5 minutes, force refresh on role changes |
| Bulk permission change affects 100+ users | Show confirmation with user count, async processing |
| API called without permission header | Fail closed - deny if unable to verify permissions |
| New resource added without permissions | Defaults to admin-only until explicitly configured |
| Migration fails mid-way | Rollback transaction, keep old role field intact |

## Technical Implementation

### Permission Service

```typescript
// lib/rbac/permission-service.ts
import { createClient } from '@/lib/supabase/server';
import { cache } from 'react';

interface EffectivePermission {
  resource: string;
  action: string;
  source: 'role' | 'client_access';
  roleId?: string;
  clientId?: string;
}

class PermissionService {
  private cache = new Map<string, { permissions: EffectivePermission[]; expires: number }>();
  private readonly CACHE_TTL = 5 * 60 * 1000; // 5 minutes

  async getUserPermissions(userId: string, agencyId: string): Promise<EffectivePermission[]> {
    const cacheKey = `${userId}:${agencyId}`;
    const cached = this.cache.get(cacheKey);

    if (cached && cached.expires > Date.now()) {
      return cached.permissions;
    }

    const supabase = createClient();

    // Get user's role and permissions
    const { data: user } = await supabase
      .from('user')
      .select(`
        id,
        is_owner,
        role:role_id (
          id,
          name,
          hierarchy_level,
          role_permissions:role_permission (
            permission:permission_id (
              resource,
              action
            )
          )
        )
      `)
      .eq('id', userId)
      .eq('agency_id', agencyId)
      .single();

    if (!user) return [];

    const permissions: EffectivePermission[] = [];

    // Add role permissions
    if (user.role?.role_permissions) {
      for (const rp of user.role.role_permissions) {
        permissions.push({

  }

  // Count owners in agency
  const { count: ownerCount } = await supabase
    .from('user')
    .select('*', { count: 'exact', head: true })
    .eq('agency_id', agencyId)

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Happy path: Create custom role with specific permissions
- [ ] Happy path: Assign role to user, verify permission enforcement
- [ ] Happy path: Member can only see/edit assigned clients
- [ ] Permission check: API returns 403 for unauthorized requests
- [ ] Permission check: UI hides unauthorized actions
- [ ] Owner protection: Cannot remove/downgrade last owner
- [ ] Ownership transfer: Properly transfers Owner status
- [ ] Role deletion: Blocked when users assigned
- [ ] Role deletion: Succeeds after user reassignment
- [ ] Permission inheritance: Manage includes all actions
- [ ] Custom role limit: Blocks creation at 10 roles
- [ ] RLS enforcement: Database queries respect permissions
- [ ] Cache invalidation: Permission changes take effect immediately
- [ ] Migration: Existing users correctly migrated to new roles
- [ ] Hierarchy: Users cannot assign roles above their level

---

## Performance Considerations

### Caching Strategy
- Permission cache per user with 5-minute TTL
- Invalidate on: role change, permission update, client access change
- Use Redis in production for distributed caching
- Cache key: `permissions:${userId}:${agencyId}`

### Database Optimization
```sql
-- Essential indexes for RBAC performance
CREATE INDEX idx_role_agency ON role(agency_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_role_permission_role ON role_permission(role_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_user_role ON "user"(role_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_member_access_user ON member_client_access(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_member_access_client ON member_client_access(client_id);

-- Composite index for permission lookups
CREATE INDEX idx_role_perm_lookup ON role_permission(role_id, permission_id);
```

### Query Optimization
- Batch permission checks when possible
- Preload permissions in auth context
- Use materialized view for complex permission calculations
- Avoid N+1 queries in permission resolution

---

## Dependencies

### Required for Implementation
- Supabase Auth with custom claims
- React Query for permission state management
- Zod for permission validation schemas

### Blocked By
- AUDIT_LOG table for permission change tracking
- User invitation system (existing)
- Settings API routes (existing)

### Enables
- Fine-grained feature access control
- Client-specific user restrictions
- Compliance and audit requirements
- Team structure customization

---

## Security & Privacy

### Access Control Principles
- **Principle of Least Privilege:** Default to no access
- **Defense in Depth:** Middleware + RLS + UI checks
- **Fail Closed:** Deny if unable to verify permissions
- **Audit Trail:** Log all permission changes and denials

### Security Measures
```typescript
// Never trust client-side permission checks alone
async function secureEndpoint(req: NextRequest) {
  // Always verify server-side
  const user = await getAuthenticatedUser(req);
  const permissions = await permissionService.getUserPermissions(user.id, user.agency_id);

  if (!permissionService.checkPermission(permissions, 'resource', 'action')) {
    // Log denial for security monitoring
    await logSecurityEvent({
      type: 'permission_denied',
      userId: user.id,
      resource: 'resource',
      action: 'action',
      ip: req.ip
    });

    throw new ForbiddenError();
  }
}
```

### Audit Logging
- All permission changes logged with actor, timestamp, before/after
- Permission denials logged for security analysis
- Role changes logged with reason
- Ownership transfers logged with approval chain

---

## Success Metrics

- **Access Control Coverage:** 100% of API endpoints have permission checks
- **Permission Denial Rate:** <5% (indicates good UX, users see what they can access)
- **Custom Role Adoption:** 30% of agencies create at least one custom role
- **Security Incidents:** 0 unauthorized data access via permission bypass
- **Migration Success:** 100% of existing users migrated without access loss
- **Performance:** Permission checks add <50ms to API response time

---

## Monitoring & Alerts

### Key Metrics
- Permission denial rate by endpoint
- Role distribution across agencies
- Custom role usage patterns
- Permission cache hit rate
- Permission check latency

### Alerting Rules
```yaml
permission_denial_spike:
  condition: denial_rate > 20%
  window: 5m
  alert: Slack

unauthorized_access_attempt:
  condition: sequential_denials_same_user > 10
  window: 1m
  alert: PagerDuty

permission_cache_miss_rate:
  condition: miss_rate > 50%
  window: 15m
  alert: Slack

role_change_volume:
  condition: role_changes > 50
  window: 1h
  alert: Email
```
