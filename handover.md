## Session 2026-01-04 (Error Handling - Testing & Documentation)

### Completed
- **Verified error display works** - Full page refresh confirms fix (commit a12dea2)
  - UI shows: "Failed to load clients" + retry button
  - Loading spinner during fetch
  - HMR interference during dev noted but doesn't affect prod

- **Added 20 new test cases** - 326 total tests passing
  - Pipeline store error handling: 12 tests (401, 500, network, CORS, retry flow, edge cases)
  - Component error display: 8 tests (rendering, retry, state isolation, accessibility)
  - New test file: `__tests__/pages/page-error-display.test.tsx`
  - Extended: `__tests__/stores/pipeline-store.test.ts`

- **Created ERROR-HANDLING.md** (200+ lines)
  - Three-layer architecture (Store → Component → UI)
  - State machine diagram
  - Error type mapping (401, 500, network, CORS, timeout)
  - Testing strategy & coverage
  - Common pitfalls & solutions (5 items)
  - Verification checklist for future changes
  - Future improvements roadmap

### Build Status
- ✅ Build passes
- ✅ 326 tests passing (15 test files, 100%)
- ✅ No TypeScript errors
- ✅ Code pushed to `linear-rebuild`

### Commits This Session
```
a12dea2 fix: add error state display for Pipeline API failures
c6f7841 docs: mark error display fix as verified
550b1d5 test: add comprehensive error handling test coverage
2ac688d docs: update handover with test coverage completion
```

### Next Steps
- [ ] Update Vercel env vars to `audienceos-cc-fresh` Supabase (then real data will show in production)
- [ ] Knowledge-base-store still uses mock data - can address if needed
- [ ] Consider implementing auto-retry with exponential backoff (future improvement in ERROR-HANDLING.md)

## Session 2026-01-04 (Supabase Data Connection)

### Completed
- **Agency renamed to "Diiiploy"** - Updated via chi-gateway MCP
- **Added supabase_update MCP tool** - Deployed to chi-gateway v1.3.0 (58 tools)
- **Chi-gateway commits pushed** - feat(supabase): add supabase_update MCP tool

### Critical Finding
Production (Vercel) is showing **mock data fallback** because env vars aren't pointing to the correct Supabase.

**Chi-gateway uses:** `audienceos-cc-fresh` (project ID: `ebxshdqfaqupnvpghodi`)

### Action Required: Update Vercel Env Vars
Go to Vercel Dashboard → audienceos-command-center → Settings → Environment Variables

Set these values:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://ebxshdqfaqupnvpghodi.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=[get from Supabase dashboard → API settings]
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=[get from Supabase dashboard → API settings]
```

After updating, redeploy the site.

### Completed
- [x] Fix silent API error display in Pipeline view ✅ **VERIFIED WORKING**
  - Commit: `a12dea2 fix: add error state display for Pipeline API failures`
  - UI shows "Failed to load clients" with retry button when API returns 401
  - Loading spinner shows during fetch
  - Note: HMR can interfere with state during dev - full refresh confirms fix works

- [x] **Add comprehensive test coverage** ✅ **326 TESTS PASSING (+20)**
  - Commit: `550b1d5 test: add comprehensive error handling test coverage`
  - 12 new unit tests for pipeline-store error handling:
    - Loading state, 401/500 errors, network failures, CORS, retry flow, edge cases
  - 8 new integration tests for component error display:
    - Error message rendering, loading spinner, successful retry, state isolation
  - Test file: `__tests__/stores/pipeline-store.test.ts` (expanded)
  - Test file: `__tests__/pages/page-error-display.test.tsx` (new)
  - Documentation: `docs/06-reference/ERROR-HANDLING.md` (200+ line comprehensive guide)
  - Build: ✅ Passes
  - All 326 tests: ✅ Passing (15 test files)

### Key Documentation
Created comprehensive ERROR-HANDLING.md that includes:
- Three-layer error architecture (Store → Component → UI)
- State machine diagram
- Error type mapping (401, 500, network, CORS, etc.)
- Complete testing strategy
- Common pitfalls avoided & solutions
- Verification checklist for future changes

## Session 2026-01-04 (Mock Data Removal Sprint)

### Completed
- Seeded Supabase with comprehensive demo data:
  - "Diiiploy" (was "Acme Marketing Agency") - direct response marketing, ~$1M/year
  - 15 clients across all pipeline stages (Onboarding → Off-boarding)
  - 4 users (admin, test accounts)
  - 7 communications (email/slack threads)
  - 4 integrations (Gmail, Slack, Google Ads, Meta - all connected)
  - 5 alerts (various severities)
  - 10 documents (various categories)
- Connected frontend to Supabase:
  - Main page now uses `usePipelineStore` → fetches from `/api/v1/clients`
  - Created `MinimalClient` type in `types/client.ts`
  - Updated kanban-board, kanban-column, dashboard-view to use new types
  - Updated `lib/client-priority.ts` to use `MinimalClient`
- Added production mock data guards:
  - Console warnings when mock-data.ts accessed in production
  - Same for mock-knowledge-base.ts
- All tests pass (306 unit tests), build succeeds

### Remaining
- [ ] Knowledge-base-store still uses mock data as initial state
- [ ] Update Vercel env vars with real Supabase URL/key to see data in production

### Architecture Note
The pipeline store already has proper API fetching:
```
usePipelineStore.fetchClients() → /api/v1/clients → Supabase RLS query
```
Mock data is now only a fallback in `use-dashboard.ts` when no real data exists.

## Session 2026-01-04 (Maintenance Sprint)

### Completed
- Verified animation fix deployed on Vercel (flexShrink:0 working ✅)
- Ran full validation: TypeScript, ESLint, 306 unit tests, build all pass
- Created `useSlideTransition` hook - DRY refactor eliminating 16 lines duplication
- Added 7 tests for new hook (accessibility, edge cases)
- Fixed E2E tests (9/10 passing, 1 skipped - needs real auth)
- **Created PR #9:** https://github.com/growthpigs/audienceos-command-center/pull/9

### Ready to Merge
PR #9 `linear-rebuild` → `main` contains:
- Animation system fixes (production-ready)
- Linear design system components
- 306 unit tests + 9 E2E tests
- CI pipeline improvements

### Next Steps
- [x] Review and merge PR #9 ✅ (merged, all checks passed)
- [x] Verify animations on production after merge ✅ (flexShrink:0 confirmed)
- [ ] Resume feature development from backlog

## Prior Sessions (2026-01-04)

### CI Smoke-test Fix + Validation
- Replaced `listCommitStatusesForRef` with GitHub Deployments API
- Added deployment protection handling
- Animation fix merged (removed `layout` prop)
- TypeScript config fixed (excluded e2e/)

### Vercel Fix + Main Merge
- Fixed pnpm lockfile error → `installCommand: "npm install"`
- Merged `linear-rebuild` into `main`
- Production verified (Pipeline, Settings, Brand tabs)

### Production Env Vars + Login Flow
- Configured Supabase env vars for Vercel
- Created test user: test@audienceos.dev / TestPassword123
- Verified login flow end-to-end

---

## Known Issues
- Turbopack local build issue - use `TURBOPACK=0 npm run build` locally
- 1 E2E test skipped (auth redirect needs real Supabase test user)

## Coverage Gaps (Non-blocking)
- `lib/supabase.ts` - 5% (database client, needs mocking)
- `stores/pipeline-store.ts` - 5% (CRUD operations)
