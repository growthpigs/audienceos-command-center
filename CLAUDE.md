## ⛔ CRITICAL: Gemini 3 ONLY Policy

**THIS PROJECT USES GEMINI 3 EXCLUSIVELY.**

| Allowed | NOT Allowed |
|---------|-------------|
| `gemini-3-flash-preview` | ~~gemini-2.0-flash-001~~ |
| `gemini-3-pro-preview` | ~~gemini-2.0-flash~~ |
| Any `gemini-3-*` model | ~~gemini-1.5-*~~ |
| | ~~gemini-pro~~ |

**If you see Gemini 2.x or 1.x anywhere in this codebase:** Stop. Fix it immediately.

---

## 🚪 MANDATORY: READ GLOBAL PAI SYSTEM FIRST

**Before doing anything on this project:**

Read `/Users/rodericandrews/.claude/CLAUDE.md` completely.

This file contains:
- The mandatory startup sequence (mem0, chi-gateway MCPs, local docs)
- Tool selection priorities (which tools to use, when)
- The entire PAI infrastructure that makes this system work

**Do not proceed with project work until you understand the global system.**

---

## 📋 ALWAYS CHECK RUNBOOK FIRST

**Before starting ANY work session:**

1. Read `RUNBOOK.md` for current operational state
2. Check deployment URLs (we use Vercel ONLY, not localhost)
3. Verify service status and configuration
4. Check for any blockers or known issues

**Current Deployment:** https://audienceos-agro-bros.vercel.app

## Intelligence Center

The Intelligence Center (`/intelligence`) is the AI hub of the application, combining chat, cartridges, and knowledge management.

### Sidebar Navigation (CANONICAL - do not duplicate)

**Assistant group:**
- Overview - AI capabilities dashboard
- Chat History - Past conversations with filters (NOT "Chat" - that was removed)
- Activity - AI activity feed

**Configuration group:**
- Training Cartridges - AI personality/behavior config (NOT "Cartridges")
- Custom Prompts - User-defined prompt templates
- AI Training Data - Documents for RAG

### File Structure

```
components/views/intelligence-center.tsx  # Main view with sub-navigation
components/linear/settings-sidebar.tsx    # Sidebar nav config (intelligenceSettingsGroups)

│   └── navigate-to.ts
app/api/chat/route.ts                     # API endpoint
```

### Training Cartridges (AI Configuration)

5-tab system for configuring AI assistant behavior:
- **Voice** - Tone and personality
- **Style** - Writing patterns
- **Preferences** - Response settings
- **Instructions** - Custom rules
- **Brand** - Company info + 112-Point Blueprint (Jon Benson framework)

Location: `components/cartridges/`

### Chat Service Configuration

```typescript
// Required env var
GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key

// Model used (Gemini 3 ONLY)
gemini-3-flash-preview
```

### Smart Router Categories

| Route | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `dashboard` | Function calling (get clients, alerts, stats) |
| `rag` | Document search |
| `web` | External search |
| `memory` | Session context |
| `casual` | General conversation |

---

## Rules for This Project

1. **Living docs only** - Update existing docs, don't create orphan files
2. **Multi-tenant** - All data scoped by agency_id with RLS
3. **Linear design** - Minimal B2B aesthetic (not glassmorphism)
4. **Feature specs** → `features/[feature-name].md`

---

## Known Issues & Fixes

### Authentication in API Calls (Fixed 2026-01-05)

**Issue:** All authenticated API calls were returning 401 "No session" errors

**Root Cause:** Fetch calls to authenticated endpoints were missing `credentials: 'include'` option, so browser didn't send session cookies

**Fixed in Commit:** 59cd1e6

**Affected Stores/Hooks:**
- ✅ `stores/pipeline-store.ts` - Client list fetch
- ✅ `stores/dashboard-store.ts` - KPIs and trends
- ✅ `stores/ticket-store.ts` - Support tickets
- ✅ `stores/settings-store.ts` - Agency settings, team members
- ✅ `stores/knowledge-base-store.ts` - Documents
- ✅ `stores/automations-store.ts` - Workflows
- ✅ `hooks/use-client-detail.ts` - Client details
- ✅ `hooks/use-integrations.ts` - Integrations
- ✅ `app/client/settings/page.tsx` - Settings page

**Fix Applied:** Added `{ credentials: 'include' }` to all fetch() calls to authenticated endpoints

---

## Multi-Org Roles & Permissions System (New Feature)

**Status:** D-1 SpecKit Complete (2026-01-08) | Phase: Ready for Implementation
**Drive Links:**
- [VISION Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ty7MvP1f_GFIoejJOhYsysI5qq6GkFopysIXUqSldwo/edit?usp=sharing)
- [SCOPE Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K4R5AkjvnIwlrXxB3UnViRK5VlP7G-Nw1bcHCUl26fM/edit)

- [API-CONTRACTS-RBAC](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rKrrUVuAqMH7ReiRMRna-XQX4fbOCgQZPePlkcJ11kA/edit)
**Local Docs:** `docs/01-product/`, `docs/04-technical/`

### Overview
Fine-grained role-based access control system for marketing agencies managing multiple clients and team members.

### Problem Solved
- **Data Exposure Risk**: Junior team members accessing sensitive client data they shouldn't see
- **Manual Access Control**: Owners spending 2+ hours/week managing permissions
- **Team Structure Mismatch**: Generic admin/user roles don't match agency hierarchies

### Solution Architecture
- **4-level role hierarchy**: Owner (1) → Admin (2) → Manager (3) → Member (4)
- **Granular permissions**: 8 resources × 3 actions per role
- **Client-scoped access**: Members assigned to specific clients only
- **Defense in depth**: Middleware + RLS working together
- **100% API enforcement**: All 34 endpoints protected

### Technical Specifications Complete
1. ✅ **B-1 Vision** - Approved (2026-01-08)
2. ✅ **B-2 Scope** - 28 DU MVP, boundaries defined (2026-01-08)
3. ✅ **B-3 Risks** - Risk register, no blockers (2026-01-08)
4. ✅ **D-1 SpecKit** - Complete technical specs (2026-01-08)
   - PRD with 18 user stories across 7 epics
   - Data Model with 5 new tables (role, permission, user_role, member_client_access, audit_log)
   - API Contracts with 15 RBAC endpoints
   - Tech Stack integration documented

### Next Steps
Ready for implementation. Use `/D-2 speckit-feature multi-org-roles` to begin development.

## API Status

All 34 endpoints documented in `docs/04-technical/API-CONTRACTS.md`

**Key Endpoints (Now Working):**
- GET `/api/v1/clients` - List clients (needs credentials)
- GET `/api/v1/dashboard/kpis` - Dashboard metrics (needs credentials)
- GET `/api/v1/tickets` - Support tickets (needs credentials)
- GET `/api/v1/documents` - Knowledge base (needs credentials)
- GET `/api/v1/workflows` - Automations (needs credentials)

**Important:** All authenticated endpoints require `credentials: 'include'` in fetch() calls

---

## Known Gotchas

1. **Credentials in Fetch Calls** - Any new API call must include `{ credentials: 'include' }`
2. **Mock Mode** - Disabled in production (NEXT_PUBLIC_MOCK_MODE not set on Vercel)
3. **Multi-tenant** - All queries must filter by agency_id or use RLS
4. **Linear Design System** - Don't use shadcn/ui directly; use components/linear/ versions
